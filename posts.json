        "content": "<p>When shopping for a laptop, you'll encounter various processor suffixes like U, P, H, and HX. Understanding these can make the difference between a laptop that meets your needs and one that falls short.</p><h2>The U Series: Efficiency First</h2><p>Intel U-series processors (like i5-1335U) are designed for maximum battery life. With a TDP (Thermal Design Power) of around 15-28W, they're perfect for:</p><ul><li>Office work and web browsing</li><li>Light photo editing</li><li>Students who need all-day battery life</li><li>Business professionals on the go</li></ul><h2>The P Series: Balanced Performance</h2><p>Introduced more recently, P-series processors (like i7-1360P) offer a middle ground with 28W TDP. They provide:</p><ul><li>Better multi-tasking than U-series</li><li>Improved graphics performance</li><li>Good balance of power and efficiency</li></ul><h2>The H Series: Performance Powerhouse</h2><p>H-series processors (like i7-13700H) are built for performance with 45W+ TDP. These are ideal for:</p><ul><li>Video editing and 3D rendering</li><li>Gaming laptops</li><li>Software development with heavy compilation</li><li>Running virtual machines</li></ul><h2>Which Should You Choose?</h2><p>Consider your primary use case. For most users, U or P series offers the best balance. Only choose H-series if you genuinely need the extra power, as you'll sacrifice battery life and portability.</p>"

        "content": "<p>After years of native development, I made the switch to Flutter — and here's why it made sense for my projects.</p><h2>One Codebase, Multiple Platforms</h2><p>The ability to write once and deploy to iOS, Android, web, and desktop from a single codebase is a game-changer. This means:</p><ul><li>Reduced development time by up to 50%</li><li>Consistent UI across platforms</li><li>Easier maintenance and updates</li></ul><h2>Hot Reload Changes Everything</h2><p>Flutter's hot reload feature lets you see changes instantly without losing app state. This dramatically speeds up the development and debugging process.</p><h2>Beautiful, Custom UIs</h2><p>Flutter's widget-based architecture makes it easy to create stunning, custom user interfaces. You're not limited by platform-specific UI components.</p><h2>Growing Ecosystem</h2><p>The Dart package ecosystem has matured significantly. Most common functionalities have well-maintained packages available.</p><h2>When Native Still Makes Sense</h2><p>That said, native development is still preferred when you need deep platform integration, maximum performance for games, or when your team already has native expertise.</p>"
